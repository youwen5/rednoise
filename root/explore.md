Here is a human-readable sitemap of sorts.
I list the pages you can visit on this website, excluding blog posts, which you can find in the [archive](/archive/).

## Menu

These are the pages you see in the main menu:

- [Home](/)
  - The main page for this site; you should start here if you haven't already.
- [Explore](/explore/)
  - That's this page (the one you're visiting *right* now!)
- [About](/about/)
  - This is a more serious answer to the question "Who am I?" It's a good place to visit after this if you want a more focused overview of this site.
- [Colophon](/colophon/)
  - This is rather unconventional for a website, but given the advanced technology used in this site's production, I figured it's a good place to explain how this was all put together. I also give credit to relevant design assets, such as the site's typography.
- [Archive](/archive/)
  - As previously mentioned, this is where you will find all of my blog posts from the beginning of time to now.

## Gardens

These are gardens of the [digital kind](https://csszengarden.com/).
They're kind of like this page: a collection of items, usually links, but sometimes images and other rich media.

- [Contact](/contact/)
  - This has all my main contact information along with links to profiles I maintain across the internet.
- [People](/people/)
  - [functor.systems](https://functor.systems/) has promised to create a commutative webring of its members at `ring.functor.systems`, but, pending the completion of that arduous project, I've put together a webring of my own (sadly it doesn't [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_ring)). This page is a collection of links to other people's personal sites that I find interesting.
  
## Philosophy

Somewhat blog post-like in style, but with less of a focus on a particular concept or idea.
Here, I opt for more general philosophical discussions about broader themes.
Most of these pages elaborate on what's discussed in the [about](/about/) page.

- [Academics](/academics/)
  - I detail my formal and informal academic background and pursuits, with some discussion about what I've learned and links to relevant resources
- [How I do my computing](/computing)
  - This is a reference to Richard Stallman's legendary [How I do my computing](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html) page. My opinions may not be as serious, and my software is certainly not as dated.
