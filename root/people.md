This is a [noncommutative webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_ring) with links to some of my friend's pages and other people that I find interesting or inspiring.
It's loosely organized into a collection of [subrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subring) that contain a list of people tied together by some common interest or affiliation.

- [Youwen Wu](https://web.youwen.dev/)

  - Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) of [functor.systems](https://functor.systems/); recently tired of studying computer science and now devotes his time to an exploration of pure mathematics [in paradise](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/). While at [Team 1280](https://www.team1280.com/), we worked on [eeXiv](https://eexiv.functor.systems/) together, now maintained under the auspices of [functor.systems](https://functor.systems/).

- [Warren Lin](https://web.kaitotlex.systems/)

  - Head of electrical engineering and most talented hacker at [functor.systems](https://functor.systems/); he [bankrolls my website](/colophon#financial-disclosures) and indirectly maintains most of my physical infrastructure through regular repairs so I can spend more time theorizing.

- [Anthony Donegan](https://github.com/anthonysdone)

  - The only other electrical engineer at [functor.systems](https://functor.systems/); he developed a [neural network entirely in HolyC](https://forgejo.mit.edu/OCL/BurningBush) and runs the startup incubator λ-combinator at MIT

- [Arvind Venkatesh](https://rvind.dev)

  - Hacker by day, musician by night; ponders a wide variety of philosophical questions relating to [linguistic shift](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/teaching/courses/2009-08UVM-300/docs/others/2003/abrams2003.pdf), [transformational music theory](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64364-9), and embodied robotic systems.

- [Nicholas Luo](https://github.com/Nluo923)

  - Theoretical computer scientist and Vulkan graphics expert; he served as head of [controls architecture](https://eexiv.functor.systems/author/nluo) over at [Team 1280](https://www.team1280.com/) immediately after I left the team, during which time he brought many bleeding edge research projects to fruition.

- [Colin Clark](https://thetech.com/photographers/colin-clark)

  - Former head of [SIPB](https://sipb.mit.edu/), [MIT ASA](https://asa.mit.edu/) (that's the club that runs all other clubs) executive, and photographer for [The Tech](https://thetech.com/); I'm clearly missing a dozen other affiliations, but I would be remiss not to mention that he is [forklift certified](https://functor.systems/#:~:text=forklift%20certified).
