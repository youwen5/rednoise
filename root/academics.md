## Now

I'm a sophomore, class of 2028, at [Mass Tech](https://share.google/VnNzKh1lkAoL3rQwy).
There, I study [Course 18-C](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18c.html), or Mathematics with Computer Science.
I'm generally interested in finding applied domains to explore using theoretical machinery in mathematics, especially [category theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory#AbstractNonsense), [algebraic topology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xLe77iTHuQ) and [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/).
I like working on problems where we can formally and rigorously prove things, but also in domains where those proofs genuinely advance our understanding of the world at large.
I want to work on the boundary of what's [intellectually tractable](https://zardini.mit.edu/Research/#:~:text=intellectually%20tractable) and genuinely insightful.
This is a theme that motivates most of my current work and research.

## Previously

I went to [San Ramon Valley High School](https://srvhs.srvusd.net/) in Danville, California.
I spent most of my time in high school building robots with [Team 1280](https://www.team1280.com/).

## Classes

In case you're not familiar, MIT has a program called [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) (OCW) that publishes the course materials for many classes at the Institute freely available online.
In most cases you can genuinely teach yourself the material by working through the course notes and assignments.
Where possible, I try to link to the OCW pages for classes I've taken, so if you're interested in any of the topics discussed, you can explore them as deeply as you like.

- [14.73](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-73-the-challenge-of-world-poverty-spring-2011/) The Challenge of World Poverty

  - This was a focused exploration of various aspects of poverty and the experience of the extreme poor in developing nations. The standard introduction to economics rarely touches on these topics and instead presents economic principles in a vacuum, without discussion of the impact of different economic philosophies on people's lives. I was lucky enough to be able to take this class with [Prof. Duflo](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/esther-duflo), whose insight into the economic studies underlying the main principles of the class was invaluable---you can actually watch most of the lectures in the class [OCW page](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-73-the-challenge-of-world-poverty-spring-2011/video_galleries/video-lectures/). I am however partial to the more theoretical side of economics and likely will not run any [randomized controlled trials](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/2016.09%20the-influence-of-rcts-on-developmental-eco.pdf), but understanding the foundational empirical methods in economics was interesting in its own right.

- [5.112](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-112-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2005/) Principles of Chemical Science
  
  - This is one of the [General Institute Requirements](https://mitadmissions.org/discover/the-mit-education/general-institute-requirements/) (GIRs) at MIT---i.e. classes that all students are required to take. Technically there are three options for the Chemistry GIR, but I decided to take 5.112 because of the emphasis on physical chemistry, thinking it would be closer to physics than chemistry. I have since learned that I do not like chemistry the subject as it's too experimental and not grounded in theory---this class is, somewhat paradoxically, one of the primary reasons I decided physics was worth studying more deeply.
